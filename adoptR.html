								Things to consider before adoption
							</div>
							<div>
								<p>
								All adoptions are limited to a 4 hour radius of our location, as determined by our GPS.
								</p><p>
								We are committed to making the best possible match between horse and rider. We represent our horses as accurately as possible by our experience with them, but as experienced handlers, we are often able to easily handle a behavior that an adopter may not.
								</p><p>
								Adopters need to realize that no single horse is ever perfect, and it is the responsibility of the Adopter to determine if the horse is appropriate for their ability and experience. We do stand behind our horses, but cannot foresee all future circumstances.
								</p><p>
								We expect Adoptive families to have weighed the decision to adopt heavily, that they are fully aware of the unforeseen expenses potential with horse ownership, and that they are committed to the horse of their choice. If you run into a problem with your new horse, we expect that you will pursue any and all options to continue to provide the horse with a good home, including training for the horse, or yourself, to overcome a problem.
								</p><p>
								All adopted horses must be returned to the care of Gentle Giants Draft Horse Rescue if, for any reason, the adopter is unable or unwilling to keep the horse. No adopted horse may be sold, loaned, leased, traded, given away, auctioned, or transferred to a third party.

											<li> Electro-Braid or Poly Rope </li>
											<li> Corral Panel </li>
											<li> Split Rail </li>
											<li> Vinyl or PVC Fencing </li>
											<li> Coated Wire </li>
											<li> High Tensile </li>
											<li> Electric Tape (minimum of 3 strands) </li>

										Fencing must be a minimum height of 4.5 feet. All fencing is expected to be in good repair, well maintained, and free of fallen debris or overgrowth. Wire fencing is expected to be tight and without sagging.
										<ul>
											<li>Cattle Grates or Cattle Guards of any kind in areas accessible to horses </li>
											<li>Barb Wire </li>

											<li>Plastic Construction or Snow Fence </li>
											<li>Step-In Posts as primary or perimeter fencing </li>
											<li>T-Posts as primary or perimeter fencing </li>

										For example, it would be acceptable to use Step-In or T-Posts as temporary fencing, a fence patch, or to create rotational grazing within a larger paddock. We do not accept either Step-In posts or T-Posts as permanent perimeter fencing.

											   <li>Run-In Sheds:  Must be of adequate size for the number of horses present, based on a 
											   measurement of 6x6 per horse.  Run-Ins must be three sided with a roof, and must have 
											   solid and reasonably clean footing. </li>  
											   <li>Stalls:  Minimum acceptable stall size is 10x10, with 12x12 or larger being strongly

										Minimum requirement of 1 fenced acre per horse.
