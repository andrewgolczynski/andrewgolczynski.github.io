Readme.txt

This .crx (Chrome extension file) works as-follows:

- Control double-click on any word to highlight it anywhere in the current document
- To dismiss the current highlight, press escape (Esc).  No other method will remove the hilighting.
- Up to 5 separate words can be selected at a time with unique colors.  Selecting more than 5 is allowed, but colors will be reused.
- Double-clicking whitespace or symbols will not cause a highlight to appear - non-word inputs are ignored

Note: Because this .crx is not from Google itself, Chrome will not accept it.  If you want to run this extension, you must load the files as an unpacked extension.
