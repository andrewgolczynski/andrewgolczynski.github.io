Readme.txt

This .crx (Chrome extension file) works as-follows:

- Double-click on any word to highlight it anywhere in the current document
- To dismiss the current highlight, open the context menu (right click).  A single click will not remove the highlighting.
- Only one highlight is possible at a time to prevent confusion - making another highlight selection (via double-click) will remove the old highlighting
- Double-clicking whitespace or symbols will not cause a highlight to appear - non-word inputs are ignored
